# rt-wui

The 5G-MAG Reference Tools Webinterface (rt-wui) provides an optional graphical webinterface with a control display for
each 5G-MAG Reference Tools process (MBMS Modem, MBMS Middleware, Application). Its main purpose is to collect and
display useful information from the MBMS Modem, MBMS Middleware and Application Process. It also enables use cases where
the 5G-MAG Reference Tools can be used for simple measurements (e.g., mobile measurements) or as a standalone device (
e.g., set-top box, mobile phone/tablet showcase).

**A detailed overview and the installation instructions can be found in
our [Wiki](https://github.com/5G-MAG/Documentation-and-Architecture/wiki/Webinterface).**
